	   <p>Here is the <a href="https//github.com/GabrielMello"> link to my game</a></p>
	 
	 <p> My project was basically me using whatever random ideas popped into my head and incorporating them in a story</p>
	 <p> This project was rather easy, it just took some time to work out some minor kinks with the text that should be printed</p>
