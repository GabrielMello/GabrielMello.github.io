       <h1> Welcome to my website</h1>
	   <p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/GabrielMello?tab=repositories"> link to my game</a></p>
	 
	 <p> My project was basically me using whatever random ideas popped into my head and incorporating them in this story. The bosses can be difficult at times and feature characters such as Shrek (lel)</p>
	 <p> This project was rather easy, it just took some time to work out some minor kinks with the text that should be printed</p>

     <p> Here is just a quick snippet of the kind of attacks you can use against the final boss</p>

Here is a picture of the final boss in my game(Supa Hot Fire, best rapper) You need to rap battle against him.

<p>Here's a snippet of code that makes it so that the boss fights can continue until someone is defeated</p>
<p> I'm actually pretty dissapointed in myself for taking like 3 days to actually figure out how to make that code</p>
<p> So I'd consider this something I struggled with</p>

<p> Quick Reflection</p>
<p> Even though this project was a bit difficult at times (cause I'm a noob and was working by myself), it was pretty fun to make :D</p>
